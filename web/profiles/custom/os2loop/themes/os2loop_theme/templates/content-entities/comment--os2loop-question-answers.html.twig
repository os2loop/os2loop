 *   the printing of a given child element:
 *   @code
 *   {{ content|without('field_example') }}
 *   @endcode
 * - created: Formatted date and time for when the comment was created.
 *   Preprocess functions can reformat it by calling DateFormatter::format()
 *   with the desired parameters on the 'comment.created' variable.
 * - changed: Formatted date and time for when the comment was last changed.
 *   Preprocess functions can reformat it by calling DateFormatter::format()
 *   with the desired parameters on the 'comment.changed' variable.

 * - submitted: Submission information created from author and created
 *   during template_preprocess_comment().

 *   - by-{entity-type}-author: Comment by the author of the parent entity,
 *     eg. by-node-author.
 *   - preview: When previewing a new or edited comment.
 *   The following applies only to viewers who are registered users:
 *   - unpublished: An unpublished comment visible only to administrators.
 * - title_prefix: Additional output populated by modules, intended to be
 *   displayed in front of the main title tag that appears in the template.
 * - title_suffix: Additional output populated by modules, intended to be
 *   displayed after the main title tag that appears in the template.
 * - content_attributes: List of classes for the styling of the comment content.
 * - title_attributes: Same as attributes, except applied to the main title
 *   tag that appears in the template.
 * - threaded: A flag indicating whether the comments are threaded or not.
 *

 * any):
 * - parent_comment: Full parent comment entity (if any).

 * - parent_created: Equivalent to created for the parent comment.
 * - parent_changed: Equivalent to changed for the parent comment.

 * - parent: A text string of parent comment submission information created from
 *   'parent_author' and 'parent_created' during template_preprocess_comment().
 *   This information is presented to help screen readers follow lengthy
 *   discussion threads. You can hide this from sighted users using the class
 *   visually-hidden.
 *
 * These two variables are provided for context:
 * - comment: Full comment object.
 * - entity: Entity the comments are attached to.
